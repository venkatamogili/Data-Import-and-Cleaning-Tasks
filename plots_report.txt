Plotting library choice: Matplotlib + Seaborn

Reasons for choice:
- Matplotlib is the standard Python plotting library with strong flexibility.
- Seaborn is built on Matplotlib and provides high-level statistical plotting with attractive defaults (heatmaps, boxplots, distribution plots).
- Together they enable easy creation of heatmaps, distribution plots, and correlation visuals required for this analysis.

Data source: NSMES1988_analysis_df.csv
Rows: 4406, Columns: 19

Week 3: Categorical analysis (Health and Region)
- Heatmap `heatmap_health_region_counts.png` shows counts of observations for each Health × Region cell.
- Stacked bar `stacked_health_by_region_prop.png` shows proportion of each health status within each region.

Observations:
- Most common health status across regions: average
  - average: 3509 records
  - poor: 554 records
  - excellent: 343 records

Week 4: Numerical analysis and correlation
- Correlation matrix saved to `correlation_heatmap.png` and numeric correlation table below:

Top correlations (absolute value sorted):
- hospital vs emergency: corr = 0.48
- ovisits vs novisits: corr = 0.47
- visits vs chronic: corr = 0.26
- income vs school: corr = 0.26
- hospital vs visits: corr = 0.24
- chronic vs hospital: corr = 0.23
- visits vs nvisits: corr = 0.23
- emergency vs chronic: corr = 0.20

Additional plots: age_distribution.png, income_distribution.png, visits_by_health_boxplot.png

Summary observations:
- Mean visits for average: 5.51
- Mean visits for excellent: 3.43
- Mean visits for poor: 8.90
- Mean income for average: 25519.90
- Mean income for excellent: 32774.11
- Mean income for poor: 19051.62
- Mean age for average: 73.85
- Mean age for excellent: 73.10
- Mean age for poor: 75.70
